# MCEBPaper

A repository for reproducing the numerical results in the following preprint:

  >Ignatiadis, Nikolaos, and Stefan Wager. "Bias-Aware Confidence Intervals for Empirical Bayes Analysis." [arXiv:1902.02774](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02774) (2019)

Also see [MinimaxCalibratedEBayes.jl](https://github.com/nignatiadis/MinimaxCalibratedEBayes.jl) for the Julia package implementing the proposed method. 

All computations were run on [Julia](https://julialang.org/) version 1.3.1 and [Mosek](https://www.mosek.com/) version 9.2. See `Manifest.toml` for specifications of Julia packages used. 

The folder structure is as follows (cf. [DrWatson.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDynamics/DrWatson.jl)):

* **src:**
* **scripts:**
* **data/sims:** 
* **literate:**
