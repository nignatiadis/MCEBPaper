# empirical-bayes-confidence-intervals-paper

A repository for reproducing the numerical results in the following preprint:

  >Ignatiadis, Nikolaos, and Stefan Wager. "Bias-Aware Confidence Intervals for Empirical Bayes Analysis." [arXiv:1902.02774](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02774) (2019)

See [Empirikos.jl](https://github.com/nignatiadis/Empirikos.jl) for the Julia package implementing the proposed method.

All computations were run on [Julia](https://julialang.org/) version 1.5 and [Mosek](https://www.mosek.com/) version 9.2. See `Manifest.toml` for specifications of all Julia packages used (in particular note that the `Empirikos.jl` interface has changed in its latest release).
